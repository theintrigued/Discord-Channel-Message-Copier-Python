This is a free-use program to be used by anyone as required for positive purposes.

INSTRUCTIONS TO USE :

(PLEASE NOTE THAT TO USE THIS IN A SERVER, YOU MUST BE A MEMBER OF IT)

The 'autho' variable refers to your authorization key, which can be taken from discord itself.
Please see related videos to achieve the above key.

For now, each copy_message function copies a single channel recent texts and pastes them in the channel of your choice.
To add more channels in the copy stream, simply copy the copy_message fuction and paste it somewhere in the file in the same naming order and change the name of the function.
Also note that another server-time storage file will be required for each channel to be copied.

Make sure to change the name of the file in the new functions that you make.

Then, call the function in the while loop given at the end of the script, with the following format:
functionName( 'Channel ID of channel to be copied from', 'Channel ID of channel to be pasted to', autho)

Hope this helps!
Please share it with your friends!

 -- HAPPY COPYING! --
